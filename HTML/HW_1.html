        Lead System Architect
        <br>
        Development of systems for automating business processes. 
        Development of a system for preparing consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, 
        including a block of parallel accounting of fixed assets. 
        Configure and support mechanisms for direct integrations between different systems using a universal data exchange format.
    </pre>
      Results:
      <ul>
        <li>
          A new system has been developed for accounting according to IFRS using
          the transformation method, which allows reducing the time for
          preparing reports from 2 month to 1 week, as well as the time for
          conducting audits reports by storing all the necessary information in
          1 database;
        </li>
        <li>
          A new system for maintaining records of contracts for a group of
          companies and the supply department, in particular, has been developed
          with the ability to configure approval processes of any complexity
          without modifying the system. This allows you to structure the storage
          of all contracts of a group of companies, increase the transparency of
          the system, create reminders about the expiration of the contract, and
          also simplify the procurement process;
        </li>
        <li>
          A subsystem for integration between various external databases has
          been developed. This made it possible to remove the responsibility
          from subsidiaries to prepare data collection forms. As a result,
          instead of 2 weeks spent by an employee filling out a data collection
          form, data downloading is performed in the background without user
          interaction in a time from 1 hour to 24 hours (depending on the amount
          of information)
